    <div class="text">This webpage is the beginning iteration of my multi-media exploration of the experieneces of enslaved people and the contributions of cultural historian, Saidiya Hartman to my thinking on the matter. Ever since 2011 when I was a Junior at Vassar College, her work has inpsired my research on Black political life and increasingly the lives of runaway slaves in the eighteenth-century British Atlantic. I am currently studying the recently published <a href="https://www.runaways.gla.ac.uk/">Runaway Slaves Project</a> created by researchers at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. The project chronicles over 800 ads created when mostly captive enslaved Africans ran away from the homes of their owners. This webpage’s title is a nod to Hartman’s 1997 book called <i>“Scenes of Subjection: Terror, Slavery, and Self-Making in Nineteenth-Century America"</i> where she notes that runaway slaves were often referred to as committing the act of “stealing themselves” or <i>“stealing away.”</i> The phrase for Hartman crystallized the objectification of enslaved people as property whose decision to runaway was understood as a form of property loss for those who claimed mastery over them.</div>

               The Runaway Slaves Project and other colonial archives like it are are often the only archival fragments left to say that any of these people existed after they were stolen from their kin. Scholars like Hartman help us to attend to these ancestors.
