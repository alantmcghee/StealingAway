               Because there are few written records left behind by enslaved people, historians of slavery gesture to the methodological challenges they face in their efforts to reconstruct the lived experience of the enslaved. As historical subjects, enslaved people face the dual paradox of being ubiquitous figures throughout the early modern Atlantic world, yet most often the ones least likely to leave behind written records or testimonies of their harrowing lives. While the general and violent condition of chattel enslavement is known, the colonial archives tend to elide the intimate nuances of enslavement. This poses a clear and troubling issue which is widely referred to as a problem of “silence[s]” in the archive. Historians like Saidiya Hartman have sought to challenge the limits imposed on the archive to challenge these silences.

               Saidiya Hartman’s article<a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/small-axe/article/12/2/1/32332/Venus-in-Two-Acts">“Venus in Two Acts” </a>foregrounded the approach of “critical fabulation” as a critical analytical practice to redress the problem of telling the “impossible stories” of the enslaved. In doing so she drew explicitly on the work of Dutch literary theorist Mieke Bal who defines “fabula…[as] a series of logically and chronologically related events that are caused and experienced by actors...” Critical fabulation refuses the project of “recovering the lives of the enslaved or redeeming the dead, but rather labor[s] to paint as full a picture of the lives of the captives as possible.”

               Critical fabulation, as Hartman explains, sets out to reconfigure “…the sequence of events in divergent stories and from contested points of view… to jeopardize the status of the event, to displace the received or authorized account..” At first glance, the idea of historians challenging the constitutive elements of an event’s sequence or chronology might lend itself to making unfounded imaginative leaps, to speak of events which didn’t happen thus destabilizing the credibility of a retelling. Hartman’s urge to “defamiliarize the familiar” forces narrators of the enslaved reliant on the presumed authority of white curated archives to understand their work as already being a type of fabulation of distant experiences. To be clear, Hartman is not the first historian to bravely toe the line between fact and fiction to strike at a deeper truth about the archive being a work of invention. Her work is squarely settled within the framework of Black feminist tradition which certain Black women and questions of race and gendered power at the center of theoretical analysis rather than the afterthought.

            <p> The work that Dr. Hartman is most known for is <i> Scenes of Subjection: Terror, Slavery, and Self-Making in Nineteenth Century America </i>which works to reconfigure how historians and commentators on the topic of chattel slavery and agency narrate these moments. The text orients towards an analytical practice of skepticism for historians relying on the Archive, which is so often built and maintained by the victors of History (capital H) when it comes to retracing perhaps even recuperating the life and lived experiences of marginalized peoples.Saidiya Hartman's work has continually made profound interventions in conversations on slavery not only in history but in interdisciplinary spaces like Black Studies. A conversation she had in Professor Frank B. Wilderson III in 2003 which is called  <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/english173/files/2017/01/Saidiya-Hartman-Interview-with-Frank-Wilderson-The-Position-of-the-Unthought.pdf">"Position of the Unthought"</a> is credited with being a text that catapulted the theory of Afro-Pessimism into the academic mainstream. Since Afro-Pessimism 's popularization Hartman has refused to position her work within the framework. Still, many of its tensions and provocations bare close ties to Hartman's ongoing attempts to redress the confining nature of how freedom is positioned in debates on racial slavery and its legacies in the present day.
