              Joseph Knight's freedom case is exceptional. There are few others like it in the record of British metropolitan society. For a historian in search of understanding the ins and outs of enslaved Black life in British society. They <a href="https://www.runaways.gla.ac.uk/database/table/">runaway ads</a> are an invaluable source that help to bring individuals into the frame of historical reference.

             This is what an a runaway ad would have looked like published in a newspaper throughout the eighteenth century Britain. The format of this ad changed little over the 80 year period time span that the archive covers.  The most important content including body description always made it into the image.
