         <h2> Joseph Knight</h2>
         <section>
            <p>
               My study of Saidiya Hartman's work and my own interest in the experience of enslaved Africans in eighteenth century Britain is what drew me to the story of Joseph Knight. Based on the <a href="http://www.slavevoyages.org/">Slave Voyages database</a>, John W. Cairns speculates that it is likely that Joseph Knight arrived as a young enslaved boy on a ship known as the Phoenix piloted by a Captain John Knight in Montego Bay on April 20, 1765.

            By the time the Phoenix arrived in Jamaica it had travelled thousands of miles from Bristol, England to Anomabu and then the Cape Coast Castle to purchase slaves and supplies. These two latter places were slave trading ports only 11 miles apart from one another in present-day Ghana. After spending almost 8 months along the African slaving coast, the Phoenix set off for its Atlantic crossing which was a perilous 46 day long journey. Upon arrival it is believed that he was named after the ship's captain Joseph Knight and bought by a planter named John Wedderburn.

            <p> <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/2146634306"> Sir John Wedderburn of Ballindean, 6th Baronet of Blackness</a> (1729-1803) and the master of Joseph Knight, was a Scottish man who fled Scotland after the failed Jaocbite uprising of 1745 against the British Crown. He soon found his fortune in sugar planting and slaveownership in Jamaica. He bought Joseph Knight at an auction and trained him as a house servant. In 1769 When Wedderburn retired from the island to Scotland he brought the teenaged Joseph with him. Joseph was later baptized and taught to read and write.

         <h2> The Knight v. Wedderburn Court Case</h2>

               Joseph Knight probably would have arrived to a cold and alien place with very few people who looked like him in view. By this point, Joseph was worlds away from his birthplace in West Africa and the home he had acclimated to in Jamaica. One can scarcely imagine the sense of loneliness that confronted Joseph in the isolated countryside estate of Balindean in Perthshire, Scotland. While the portrait at the top of the page is not one of Joseph Knight and his master together, it helps offer a window into the type of intimate proximity that Joseph might have had to his master in Britain during quotidian moments. As a Black servant in rural Scotland, he would have undoubtedly stood out not only as a Black man but because of his proximity to the wealthy Wedderburns. Unlike elsewhere in Great Britain, Black people in Scotland did not form sizable enclaves like in the southernly English port cities of Liverpool and Bristol. Much like Joseph, they were often found working as domestic labor. Joseph Knight fully entered the historical record after his attempt to run away from his master in Scotland was barred by Scottish courts. The <i>Knight v. Wedderburn case</i> was one of the few freedom cases in Great Britain enshrined in the historical record. Probably because they were rare and hard to perform. It seemed that Knight might have been encouraged to make a case because of his relationship and marriage to one of Wedderburn's other house servants named Ann Thompson, a Scottish woman from Dundee. Most other runaway slaves disappeared into British metropolitan society. Knight's case against John Wedderburn was ultimately successful. In the end he won his freedom and neither he nor his wife were ever mentioned in the archives again.
