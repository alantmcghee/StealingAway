         <p> Published in 1999 as a CD-ROM, the <a href="http://slavevoyages.org/">Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database (TASTD)</a> is a repository of over 35,000 slave trading journeys which transpired between 1520 and 1866. It is sponsored by a group of non-profit institutions which include <a href="http://digitalscholarship.emory.edu/projects/featured/voyages-slave-trade.html"> Emory University</a>, the <a href="https://www.neh.gov/">National Endowment for the Humanities </a>,and the <a href="https://hutchinscenter.fas.harvard.edu/trans-atlantic-slave-trade-database"> Hutchins Center for African and African American Research (Harvard University)</a>.

               The book <i> Saltwater Slavery: A Middle Passage from Africa to American Diaspora</i> by Stephanie Smallwood shows how the violent hyper-mobility of slave ships was contrasted by the unidirectional movement of the enslaved being pushed into a completely new world through what we now call the Middle Passage. Smallwood marshals the shipping records of the Royal Africa Company's trade between 1675 and 1725. Often these records are passed over because it is notoriously difficult to tell a story from impersonal numerical data sets like these. In the words of historian Marissa Fuentes Stephanie Smallwood "shifts the epistomological weight of the archive" and looks at the systems of procurement and conveyance of enslaved people to create an imaginative space to consider what it meant for the enslaved to be pulled into the violence of captivity from West African homes to New World plantation. These enslaved people who were pulled away from their natal homes could not be thought of as "creoles" since they were not born in the New World so they were often referred to by their contemporaries (including other slaves and white observers) as <em> "saltwater slaves."</em> To be called a saltwater slave both explicitly and implicitly placed their origins somewhere in the impersonal consuming aqueous territory of the Atlantic with no abiding home in site.

               Thinking of enslaved people through the given framework of data run the risk of creating dangerous abstractions of people. This can disensistize contemporary observers as Toni Morrison refuses to let happen. Smallwood is able to show is that displacement didn’t only disrupt the social netowrks of African captives but it constituted a profound shattering of their sacred geography. The disorientation of forced migration left captives uncertain about the distances they were covering, resulting in instances where recently arrived captives ran away to make attempts to re-cross the Atlantic unaware of the magnitude of distance they had covered. This traumatic experience also challenged the capacity of Africans to practice funerary rites which they had practiced in their native lands. From the point of view of the enslaved African, the distinctions between what Empire they found themselves in sometimes collapsed, the view was bleak all around.

            A narrative tension that historians have sought to apprehend is the meticulous and silencing extent to which enslaved African people have appeared as data in debates about their commodification. The end-result of this commodification and alienation of enslaved peoples from their labor figure centrally in what today is a sprawling conversation on the new history of capitalism as evidenced by the works of scholars like Walter Johnson, Sven Beckert, Edward Jean Baptiste, Caitlin Rosenthal and many more. Researchers in this space of analysis are interested in better understanding the extent to which Atlantic chattel slavery contributed to the rise of Western capitalism. Some critics have called for a closer reading of the fragmentary record of shipping records of trade to in Smallwood's hope, “bring[s] the people aboard slave ships to life as subjects in American social history.”

            Rather than setting aside these documents which account for enslaved people as units of labor and exchange, Jennifer Morgan highlights what she calls “colonial numeracy” or the ongoing ways that enslaved people were rendered into the calculus of mass trade and commodification in the trans-Atlantic slave trade economy. As a historian of woman and gender, the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database (TASTD) is a particular vexing archive for her questions about the life of enslaved women. According to Morgan, the “protocols of aggregation and extrapolation that are at the heart of any attempt to understand the experience of slavery prove to be particularly vexing for the scholar of gender and enslavement.” Many records of these slaving voyages omitted to state the gender of the captives as well as other more intimate information about the captives like where they came from, their names, their beliefs, their tribal affiliations etc.
